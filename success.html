                    <h2>Mister Jones, a large chow/lab mix, arrived at the Cleveland APL in April 2017.</h2>
                    <p>At 12 years old he wasn’t the young pup that most people are in search of, but after a summer at the APL bewitching the staff and volunteers, he caught the eye and heart of Carrie. A year after Carrie’s dog had passed away, she finally felt ready to find a new canine companion. Last fall, she went to the APL and immediately fell in love with Mister Jones and his playful yet laid back charm. Once all alone and without a loving owner, Mister Jones will never be at a loss for love again. In a wonderful turn of luck, Mister Jones has gotten three humans for the price of one and spends his days happily doted upon by Carrie and her parents, now a happy little family of four.</p>

                        <h2>Poor little puppy, Callie, was having a hard time finding her forever home after being listed on our pet adoption portal.</h2>
                        <p>One day, a college student, feeling overwhelmed with caring for Callie, brought her back to our partner shelter through the adoption portal. Callie was listed again for adoption, and we featured her on the homepage, hoping she would catch the eye of a loving family.

                            Soon after, Callie’s story caught the attention of Asha and Vinod, a couple who had lost their beloved senior dog a few months ago. They hadn’t planned to adopt another pet, but when they saw Callie’s profile and read her story on our portal, it was love at first sight.
                            
                            Eager to meet her, they didn’t just fill out the application; they visited the shelter that same day. Their bond with Callie was instant. Despite other applications submitted online, Asha and Vinod’s dedication and connection to Callie stood out. With the help of our adoption team, they completed the process, ensuring that Callie was going to the perfect home.
                            
                            Now, Callie, lovingly renamed "Maya," has finally found her forever family. Thanks to our pet adoption portal, she’s no longer searching—she’s home.</p>

                        <h2>Anjali had always wanted a companion, especially after moving to a new city for work. She felt an adult cat would be the perfect fit, providing her with love and comfort during the quiet moments of her day.</h2>
                        <p>Given her busy work schedule and occasional travel for her job, Anjali wanted a calm and laid-back cat that wouldn’t dash out of the door every time it opened. She searched through profiles on our pet adoption portal and finally visited a nearby shelter partnered with us, where she met Mittu, a gentle gray and white cat. The moment they saw each other, there was an instant connection.

                            Mittu had some minor health concerns, including a respiratory issue and a skin condition, but Anjali wasn’t deterred. She knew that with a little extra care, Mittu could thrive. After adopting her through our portal, Anjali gave Mittu all the attention and care she needed.
                            
                            Today, Anjali and Mittu—now affectionately called "Simba"—are inseparable. Anjali says that Simba has become her best friend, always there to greet her after a long day at work. More than just a pet, Simba has brought warmth, joy, and companionship into her life, exceeding all her expectations. Thanks to the adoption portal, Anjali found the perfect furry friend who completes her life in every way.</p>
